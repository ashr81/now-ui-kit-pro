## Short Description
**Now UI Kit Pro** is a premium responsive Bootstrap 4 kit provided by [Invision](http://www.invisionapp.com) and
[Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com). It is a beautiful cross-platform UI kit featuring over 1000+ elements and 11 templates. Now UI Kit is one of the most popular UI Kits online, provided in PSD and Sketch formats by Invision. We wanted to find a way for developers worldwide to benefit from using it. So, in collaboration with Invision, we are launching the HTML version for it!

Now UI Kit will help you create a clean and simple website that is a perfect fit for today's flat design. It is built using the 12 column grid system, with components designed to fit together perfectly. It makes use of bold colours, beautiful typography, clear photography and spacious arrangements.


## Getting Started
The **Now UI Kit Pro** is built on top of Bootstrap 4, so you can safely use it on your existing or a new Bootstrap project. No line of code from Bootstrap 4 was changed, so you don't have to worry about undesired effects in your work.

We provide all the necessary CSS resources. To get going, just include
`assets/css/now-ui-kit.css` in your HTML template. Your project will get the new look.

The easiest way to start is to use our [start-up template](template.html) where all the files are already included and ready to use.
